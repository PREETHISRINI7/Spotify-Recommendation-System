Spotify is one of the largest music streaming service provider in the world and most of us use it on a daily basis. When we listen to a random song, there are few songs which list up automatically based on the users preferences as well as the current songs feature. I have tried to achieve the same thing here in this project by making a recommendation system that gives song suggestions based on an input song provided to it.

The goal of this project is to create a Spotify song recommender system that would give consumers a list of songs based on their preferences and the song's auditory characteristics. Help users to assist in selecting songs depending on their preferred song by utilizing a variety of unsupervised machine learning techniques as well as assessing and interpreting these models.

There are generally two basic types of recommender systems:
1. Collaborative filtering
2. Content-based systems

I have used content based filtering system. The content-based filtering algorithm is based on a description of the element and a profile of a userâ€™s preferences. These algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user has liked in the past. The main advantages of content based filtering systems are their simplicity of use and comprehensive level of coverage.
